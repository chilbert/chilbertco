## Should I even waste my time?

I've never used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) before and wanted something I could get my site up and running with quickly.

But see, I'm not a designer. I can hold my own on small amounts of original
graphical work, but I'm no Illustrator pro. And so I started out at
[Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org), and on page 1 ran across the
theme [Halve](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve) by Taylan TatlÄ±.

## Goals and Such

Immediate goals for the site are to begin documenting the roller coaster ride of running a business.  [Spacetime](http://www.heyspacetime.com) has nearly been in business a year and we are growing!  Year two will only be that much better if we learn from year 1.  This is my attempt to do so.

### _Cheers!_
