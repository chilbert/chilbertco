# Hello.  I'm Chase.

I am a business owner, leader, developer, and problem solver with a love for people, technology, [craft beer](http://www.guidelive.com/craft-beer/2015/11/05/beginners-craft-beer-styles-guide?hootPostID=43e235b0083bfd39b0ea3f2c542f59d5) and [Stumptown Coffee](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/). On any given day, some or all these things are necessary to get the job done. I have had the privilege of working with clients from start-ups, non-profits, and seasoned organizations that all bring something challenging to the table. Meeting interesting people, building strong relationships, and helping them to shape their digital products is what makes getting up for work everyday an exciting proposition for me.

My goal is always to improve the way people create and use technology, transforming industries one project at a time. I spend a large part of my life learning new things and honing new skills in an effort to evolve not only on a personal level, but also my skill set and understanding of technology. I am a Co-Founder of [Spacetime](http://heyspacetime.com), I own a [Vizsla](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/vizsla/), I play guitar for the Jared Wood Band, and I spend a large amount of time in an [Eno](https://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/doublenest.html). I sleep, create and drink coffee on the daily in Plano Texas (always subject to change). Would love to hear from you.
