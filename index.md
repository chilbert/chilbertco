# Hello.  I'm Chase.

I am a business owner, leader, developer, and problem solver with a love for people, technology, music, bourbon and coffee. On any given day, some or all these things are necessary to get the job done. I have had the privilege of working with clients ranging from start-ups to non-profits to seasoned organizations that all bring something challenging to the table. Meeting interesting people, building strong relationships, and helping them to shape their digital products and online presence is what makes getting up for work everyday an exciting proposition for me.

My goal is always to improve the way people create and use technology, transforming industries one project at a time. I spend a large part of my life learning new things and honing new skills in an effort to evolve not only on a personal level, but also my skill set and understanding of technology.  

I am currently a student in a Software Engineering bootcamp with [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and loving it.  Stay tuned for some writings on my experience. Professionally speaking, I am a Co-Founder of [Spacetime](http://heyspacetime.com)(we have some awesome clients), I work with a sweet startup [StudioHop Fitness](https://studiohopfitness.com), and I play guitar for the [Jared Wood Band](http://jaredwoodmusic.com).  More importantly, I am a husband, a father and an aspiring reader. I own a [Vizsla](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/vizsla/), I drive a Tundra, I love my church, and I love the outdoors (for sport, hunting and camping). I reside in Plano, Texas and I would love to hear from you.
